## 🎯 Next Up

Based on the implementation plan, the next milestones are:

1. **Graph Database Interface** (Days 3-4)
   - Neo4j connection
   - CRUD operations for claims, edges, gaps

2. **Seed Physics Axioms** (Day 5)
   - 50 fundamental physics axioms
   - Mathematical constants
   - Physical laws

3. **Decomposition Engine** (Days 6-8)
   - Question parsing
   - Sub-claim generation
   - Recursion to axioms

## 📝 Notes for Non-Technical Review

**What We Built Recently:**
- Core data structures (Claim, Edge, Gap, Source models)
- Configuration system for managing settings
- Unit tests to ensure code quality
- Daily briefing system (this email!)

**What This Means:**
- We have the "building blocks" to store knowledge
- Think of Claims as facts in our database
- Edges connect facts together (e.g., "F=ma derives from Newton's laws")
- Gaps identify what we don't know yet

**Technical Debt:** None yet (early stage)

**Blockers:** None

## 🚀 Vision Reminder

We're building a first principles truth machine that will:
1. Store all human knowledge as a graph
2. Verify claims against physics axioms
3. Identify gaps in human understanding
4. Generate new research questions
5. Accelerate toward technological singularity

Current focus: Physics foundation (classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism)
